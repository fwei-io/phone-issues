# VR Glass PC Issues

2021.07.22 Issues:

1. Cannot detect VR Glass, but 6DoF and controllers are detected through VR Glass. We have tried unplugging DisplayPort, USB, restart PC, restart Steam VR, PC VR Assistant but it still cannot detect VR Glass. What are the steps to troubleshoot?

2. Cannot update the controller firmware through HW VR PC Assistant. How can we get the older firmware (one controller) upgraded?
