# The nearby find friends function cannot be used on HMS device

We have no luck to reproduce this issue. We tried:
1. Create account A and account B. A and B do not have Bitmoj avatar. A and B are friends. B shared its location to its friends
2. Install current app from Google Play Store on Huawei Mate 10 lite/EMUI 8 and log in with account A 
3. A navigates to the map page and observes -> A could see friend B
4. Install v11.26.0.30 HMS version from AppCenter on Huawei P40 Pro/EMUI 10.1.0 and log in with account A (could not search out app from Huawei's application market, maybe the device is a Chinese version?)
5. A navigates to the map page and observes -> A could see friend B

Could you please ask the test team to verify on another Huawei device with our app in HMS version and see the result?
